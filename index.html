                <p class="text-justify">For a long time I have wanted to be involved with programming and have always dabbled and enjoyed. From making games as a teenager for fun to
                     helping previous employers set up an ecommerce website. I am now eager to try and make it my career, I would love the need to constantly learn, adapt and problem
                      solve. I am currently studying with Hyperion Dev on their sofware engineering bootcamp and enjoying it a lot. I've always been a strong problem solver and enjoy
                       logically working through problems. I am working full time in a completely different field and searching for the opportunity to program full time and completely 
                       emmerse myself in it.

                    I most enjoy automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflow with functions. I also enjoy data analysis with numpy and pandas, I hope my soft 
                    skills and life experience can help play a role in thinking creatively towards new tasks. I am commmited to continually learning whatever skills I need to assure I am able
                     to apply myself most optimally to whatever is required of me. I really am searching for an opportunity to put myself in a position I know I will enjoy and thrive in.

        <h2 class="text-light text-center">Natural Language processing</h2>
        <p>For this project I used spacy to read in and analyse some example movies from a text file. I then had an example movie of my own to compare to these using spacy
            as my nlp module. I stored the movies from the text file into a dictionary (title as key and description as the values) and iterated through them keeping track of 
            which one was most similar. The program then returns the result of the most similar movie. 
        </p>
        <p><i>I really enjoyed working with spacy and can see its application in search suggestions, advertising, translation, auto-correct, chatbots / virtual assistants 
            and more.</i></p>

        <h2 class="text-light text-center">Inventory</h2>
        <p>For this project I wanted to show an understanding of Object Oriented Programming. It is a basic stock control system that uses the class <i>'shoe'</i>
        to read in a selection of stock objects from a text file and perform tasks like showing the highest stocked item or searchin for a shoe by SKU code. </p>

        <p><i>I really enjoyed how object oriented programming made tasks (especially iteration and data storage, i.e. vs a list or dictionary) more efficient
            to code and clearer to read than procedural or even function based programming. I can see how this paradigm can make projects more approachable from a collaboration
            standpoint but also just clearer and more modular to work on. I will strive to stick to this modality on future projects.

            <h2 class="text-light text-center">Task Manager</h2>
            <p>For this project I wanted to showcase the ability to use external files, functions and iterate lists with a hypothetical task management system. It features a log in system
                that reads users from an external .txt file. The ability to add and edit users tasks which is output to a .txt file. It also allows the user to create reports
                as .txt files. There are some functions only available to the admin.
            </p>
            <p><i>I really enjoyed working with text files and loops. Creating functions for the various tasks helped to keep the code clean. I did this module before learning
                about OOP and am happy with how it turned out.

            I thrive in team environments, whether in office workplaces or outdoors and enjoy a technical challenge - be it completing a task or acquiring new skills. 
            I have friendly customer service skills and a warm disposition offering a confident and reliable mindset. I am patient and thoughtful in my manner having 
            partaken in multiple managerial / customer facing roles. I offer a spirited, hardworking ethos with initiative and drive, both within a team and in solitude,
            and aim for personal and team efficiency in my duties</p>
            <p>
            Keen to learn new technologies and apply them to solving problems I will dedicate myself to continually growing and working hard to see projects completed. 
            Although I am coming from outside the field I have a lot of experience from a broad range of settings that will strengthen my ability to work in a team or 
            independently.</p>

            <p>
            I am consistently hard working and will strive to be an asset to your company or project.</p>
